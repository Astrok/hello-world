# hello-world

Hi guys,
I am someone looking to become a better coder. To be honest, I have very little experience with code. I probably started writing things to edit something in a game, then started learning commands in cmd, and made basic into more advanced batch files. They weren't anything extrodinary, just things to save my time. I would say my 'best' piece of work to do with batch was a messenger i made, which had accounts with passwords etc. and an msg box. Next, I learnt HTML (which i am still medioka at), and now now looking to focus on a particular language in my free time(i think javascript).
